        - Remove pod-coverage from MANIFEST also.
        - Rewrite Makefile.PL to better check ExtUtils::MakeMaker version and

0.13    2012-08-19
        - Removed pod-coverage since it just fails, the 3 subs don't need
        individual documentation since its covered by XMLRPC::Server and
        XMLRPC::Transport::HTTP::CGI.
        - Added encoding to pod.

0.12    2012-08-03
